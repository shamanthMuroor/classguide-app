                            1. The main objective of this system is to transform the class into team / WE- FORCE.
                            2. To develop a sense of identity, we feeling, and confidence among students.
                            3.  To recognise the special gifts and talents of every student so as to promote their growth and development towards higher level of competency, creativity and fulfilment.
                            4. To establish adult to adult relationship between the staff and the students and to create a favourable environment in the campus to achieve authentic education. 
                            Eg: The role of class guide/Mentor is best illustrated in case of Helen Keller. As a young child she was not only deaf and blind but nearly demented in her behaviour. It was because of the dedication, insight and hard work of her teacher Anne Sullivan Helen was able to realise her intellectual and artistic gifts.
