                                <li>To establish adult to adult relationship between the staff and the students and to create a favourable environment in the campus to achieve authentic education.</li>

As a young child she was not only deaf and blind but nearly demented in her behaviour. It was because of the dedication, insight and hard work of her teacher Anne Sullivan Helen was able to realise her intellectual and artistic gifts.</p>
